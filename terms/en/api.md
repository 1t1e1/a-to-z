API stands for an application programming interface. They make it possible to talk about different technologies to each other. An API allows the sharing of data or functions of a digital product with another digital product. They provide a clearly defined interface to enable various components of larger applications to work together, and they can reduce the amount of code that is required. In other words, they serve as bridges between your components, even if they were developed by different companies.
