A flowchart is an easy-to-understand, visually presented diagram depicting the overall process. You will find that a flowchart is often used in business, science, and information technology-related activities, but they are equally useful for administrative processes. A flowchart will be of great use to you if you are the kind of person who likes visual solutions to problems.
