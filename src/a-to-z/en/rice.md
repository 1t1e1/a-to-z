RİCE is a prioritizing framework for product management that stands for reach, impact, confidence, and effort. RİCE helps us to focus on what matters most in a manageable way. When prioritizing something, we need to consider our reach, which is how many people are going to bear the consequences of our work. We must evaluate the impact which is how big of an impact is this task going to have.
