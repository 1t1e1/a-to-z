The graphics interchange format (GIF) is a sort of bitmap picture format established by CompuServe in 1987. The format allows up to 8 bits per pixel, giving a picture access to a 255-color palette. The greatest distinguishing feature of GIF is its support for animation, with each frame allowing for the usage of a new palette.
